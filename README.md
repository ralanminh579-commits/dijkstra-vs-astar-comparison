# Comparison of Dijkstra and A* Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation and experimental comparison
between Dijkstra and A* algorithms for solving the shortest path problem.

## Features
- Graph representation with weighted edges
- Euclidean heuristic for A*
- Performance comparison based on:
  - Path cost
  - Number of expanded nodes
  - Priority queue operations

## How to run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
